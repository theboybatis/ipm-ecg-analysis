The algorithm here, designed  to detect the QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram, was first  described by Nygårds and Sörnmo in 1983 in:

Nygårds M. E. and Sörnmo L.,  Delineation of the QRS complex using the envelope of the ECG, Med. & Biol. Eng. & Comput. 21:538-547, 1983

and subsequently modified by Hamilton, Pan and Tompkins in 1985 and 1986 in:

Pan J and Tompkins WJ. A Real-Time QRS Detection Algorithm. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 32(3):230-236, 1985.

Hamilton P. S. and Tompkins W. J. , Quantitative investigation of QRS detection rules using the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 33(12):1157-1165, 1986.

The algorithm posted here was originally written from scratch in C by G. D. Clifford and includes updated from the citations above. which are described in:

Clifford G.D., Signal Processing Methods for Heart Rate Variability, DPhil. Thesis, Oxford University, Michaelmas 2002. Please cite this when using the code.

Please cite this latter publication when using this code.

Translation into Java with minor modifications was performed by J. Oster.
